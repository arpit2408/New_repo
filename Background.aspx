    <h2>The Texas Crop Registry</h2>
        <h3>An essential tool to minimize the impact of pesticide drift</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
The purpose of the Texas Crop Registry is to assist pesticide applicators in eliminating or reducing off-target drift.  The Registry is presented in the form of a website where farmers, ranchers, green house growers, bee keepers and others can enter the exact location and relevant information of their crop, or enterprise, on a computerized map.  The type and location of their crop is then made available to pesticide applicators through this registry.  Pesticide applicators can search the registry (by county, crop or geographic area of interest) to inform themselves on the location of nearby crops and their sensitivity to off-target drift.   Plans can then be made to eliminate or minimize pesticide drift.
</p >
 <p>          
Pesticides, particularly herbicides and insecticides, are valuable and essential tools for crop and range-land production.  Off-target pesticide drift can result in direct crop damage or contamination.  Many specialty crops, such as grapes, pecans, watermelons, tomatoes, nursery crops, etc. are sensitive to commonly used herbicides.  This is also the case with some field crops that do not possess herbicide tolerance in their genetics.   Organically grown crops are constantly at risk of exposure to pesticide drift.  
</p>
<p>
In recent years, herbicide tolerant and insecticide genes have been introduced into a range of field crops, such as cotton, soybeans and corn.   For example, Roundup (glyphosate)  Ready  and Liberty (glufosinate) Link herbicide tolerant genes, as well as B.t. (eg. Bolstar-cotton) insecticidal genes,  have been inserted into field crops.  Herbicide tolerant crops, specifically, have given producers an extremely powerful weed control tool after the crop has emerged by using an over-the-top herbicide application.  The expanded use of over-the-top treatments has also increased the risk of off-target herbicide drift.  Over the next 5-6 years, soybeans, cotton, sorghum, corn and other crops with genes conferring tolerance to Dicamba, 2,4-D and other herbicides will be introduced.  Efforts must be made to preserve and protect these highly effective technologies.  Field, specialty and other crops not containing herbicide tolerant genes will be at greater risk of exposure to drift from multiple herbicides.
</p>
<p>
The Texas Crop Registry will be even more important, if not essential, in the future by providing key information to both private and commercial applicators that will assist them in dealing with drift. 
</p>
<p>
The registry is intended for commercial sites that are at least a half-acre.  It is not intended for homeowners. To be in the registry, the crops: 
</p>
<ul>
 <li>
Must be for commercial use.
    
    <li>
Must meet minimum total acreage requirements of:
    </li> 
    <ul>
    <li>
Half an acre for fruits and vegetables
    </li> 
    <li>
One acre for all other crops and  certified organic crops
    </li> 
    <li>
If it is an organic crop, it must be produced under an organic certification program.
    </li> 
        </ul>
     </li> 
</ul>
    <h3>How to Register</h3>
       
        <p>
        Producers can register their crops by filling out the online registration form, click on the 'producer' or 'applicator' menu link to register. Multiple locations can be listed for a single producer. 
</p>
<p>
    Crop, honeybees, nursury, etc. entries will include maps and a location descriptions to make it easier for pesticide applicators to know where the crops are when they use the search feature. 
    </p>
<p>
    Pesticide applicators can easily locate registered sites before they spray using a map interface.
 </p>
    <p>
    To keep the registry current, you will be notified annually to confirm registration and provide updates in mm/dd/yy. For assistance, contact (name of the department/person) within the Knowledge Engineering Laboratory or Agriculture and Environmental Safety  program at Texas A&M. 
</p>
<p>
    Registered producers and beekeepers may update their information at any time during the year. However, because registration expires December 31st of each year, producers and beekeepers that wish to remain actively registered must confirm, and edit if necessary, their registration information beginning in January of the following year.
