                            <p>The concept of Hit the Target -The Crop Registry System- originated from registries used by other states, and from concerns among Texas grape growers that vineyards grown adjacent to other crops could be damaged by pesticide drift. Development of the registry began with funding from the Texas Department of Agriculture Specialty Crop Block Grant and support from Texas Grape Growers Association. The philosophy of the site is simple: If pesticide applicators can easily see the location of other crops that may be affected by drift, they can and will make appropriate plans to avoid damage.  With the integration of Flag the Technology into the system functionality, herbicide applicators will be aware which products are appropriate and safe to use on a specific field.</p>

                            <p>For producers, using the site is straightforward. First, register with the site following the instructions above. Your registration details are confidential. Registration allows us (the site administrators) to update you with news about the site, and to ensure only valid crop areas are added to the registry. Once registered, you can use the online mapping tools to delineate the boundaries of your fields, and record the types of crops grown there. In order to ensure a current and accurate database, crop locations will remain in the database for a year, before they need to be updated. </p>

                            <p>From this point, the location of your crops (represented by the color of the flags) will be visible to any applicator registered with the site. Producers have the ability to share their data with applicators and consultants, and are provided with online tools that allow them to generate real-time reports before they carry out an application.</p>

Once registered, you can use the user dashboard to see the location of shared crop areas where the pesticide application will take place. Before an application, you can use the online tools to see where the physical flags are and comments left to you by the producer. Applicators can maintain a record of all applicator areas (in case further applications are scheduled).</p>
